# Json-REST-Client

An abstraction for using REST with JSON in Java, most of the code is extracted and modified from [zendesk-java-client](https://github.com/cloudbees/zendesk-java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zendesk/client/v2/Zendesk.java) to be able to use for multiple REST-JSON integrations.
